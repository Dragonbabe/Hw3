# Random Password Generator

This project was interesting and I got to practice JavaScript. I recently learned all about doing prompts and alerts and confirms. And now I got to put that information into practice in this project!

## Getting Started

As you open up this file, you will get prompted to enter different characters and the program will generate you a random password based on the characters you chose.

### Prerequisites

A laptop or PC.

## Running the tests

You will need to make sure you that you enter the criteria that the prompts asks you or else you will not get your randomly generated password.
